# About
This code is part of the paper [*Multiagent Rollout with Reshuffling for Warehouse Robots Path Planning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08201).

# Installation

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/will-em/multi-agent-rollout.git
cd multi-agent-rollout 
```
To compile and run **Multiagent rollout**:
```sh
make && ./rollout 
```
<!-- -->
For benchmarking purposes, the **[Cooperative A*](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cooperative-Pathfinding-Silver/03ef7f3a962319a8d97cacb6afa5380948eba1be)** algorithm has also been implemented. To compile and run it:
```sh
make coop && ./coop
```

# How to edit the scenario

If you want to modify the layout or the cost function of the environment, please see [Environment.cpp](src/Environment.cpp). If you want to modify the delivery points, they are defined in [Simulate.cpp](src/Simulate.cpp) and [SimulateCoop.cpp](src/SimulateCoop.cpp) for each method respectivly. Likewise, to specify the number of agents, go to file [Rollout.cpp](src/Rollout.cpp) or [Coop.cpp](src/Coop.cpp).
